          Let’s picture this: you’re a high school student in their junior year, and you’re about to become a senior. You’ve now been tasked with the question, what are you going to do for college? How will you pay for it? Is there another way to get to your goals? If so, what are they?

      <h3> What is this page? </h3>
      <br>
      
     <p class = "what">
        Our page has one main goal: to help people understand the importance of decision-making better. Decision-making is a complex process that we all have to deal with, but some of us have a more difficult time on a regular basis making the challenging decisions that could affect our lives.
        <br><br>
        We'll be talking about three different topics, which will begin with...
     </p>
      <br><br>
      <hr class = "style1">
      <h3> How Realistic An Option Is</h3>
      <p class = "what">
        While it’s a simple concept, many people fall victim to setting too complicated of a goal or wanting to do something that is nearly impossible. Understanding what you can and can’t do is crucial when making a decision.
        <br><br>
        As an example, let’s say you’re deciding on a college, but you don’t have a large amount of money to spend on it. An option that you could take is pursuing a full ride to an ivy league university, but that is obviously not something you can guarantee your control over. 
        <br><br>
        Another option that you could think of is possibly going to community college for two years and saving up money for another college during that time. This is a much more realistic outcome for most people. 
        <br><br>
        This is a simple example with a bit of hyperbole, but keeping in mind how realistic something is will help greatly when making a decision.

      </p>
      <br><br>
      <hr class = "style1">
      <h3> How the option fits into your schedule </h3>
      <br>
      <p class = "what">
        The results of this will vary a lot depending how much you can commit to everything you’re doing. Let’s break it down more.
    <br><br>
        Just as an example, let’s say that you want to get into better shape. You may start thinking about exercising almost every single day for an hour. That’s a         good idea but now we have to think about how much time you actually have to spare. You want to start exercising an hour a day, but for this, let’s pretend that you start your day around 7 AM and you get home around 5 PM. This starts making things a bit tricky, but still makes the one hour of exercise doable, albeit difficult. 
    <br><br>
        However, this is not considering what other things you may need to do, such as food shopping, making dinner, plans with friends or family, taking care of pets, and many other things. Some tasks you may be able to postpone and spend that time exercising, but some may require your full attention. There could even be some options that allow you to do what you need to do and get the exercise you want done! 
    <br><br>
        It’s important to look at each decision carefully in terms of your schedule and what you’re trying to accomplish. The idea of doing an hour of exercise             everyday is a good one, but keeping in mind what you have to do everyday will allow you to make a plan that fits your schedule more. <br>
        Something more realistic for most may be exercising every other day for an hour. Once you have good ideas on how you can achieve what goal you have, thinking about how it’ll fit into your life is also important. Knowing if there are things that you can’t drop, such as work or taking care of someone, or things you can drop, such as recreational activities, can help when trying to fit things into your life.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <hr class = "style1">
      <h3>How the option brings you closer to your goal</h3>
      <p class = "what">
        Lastly, we need to figure out good ways to pick your options. Luckily, all we have to do is figure out what your goal is.
    <br><br>
        Yet again, let’s talk about another example. This time, we can pretend that you’re trying to find a group of people you can relate to. An option you may have is a club at your school, but what club do you pick? That’s another thing to think about, what do you WANT people to relate to? There are a ton of things you could like, such as writing, coding, playing music, playing games, and a ton of other things. So then that would expand your thought process of your goal, you want people to relate to you on their love of coding, as an example. It doesn’t have to be coding, it could be anything you like or want people to have a similar interest in. The concept I’m trying to get across is that when you decide you want to do something, you have to make sure that what you’re doing is something that you actually want. If you’re into music, but end up joining a writing club, that might not go as well for you.

      <h3>Ending</h3>
      <p class = "what">
        Hopefully what you read here was useful and you can use it on any of your tough future decisions. I can’t go over every single important skill you would need for decisions in a small webpage, but the three I brought up I believe are valuable enough to stand on their own as a bit of advice towards making some decisions.
        <br><br>
        After reading through all of that, I’m sure that you just can’t wait to do even more reading, although hopefully this part will be a little more fun!
